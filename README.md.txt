ðŸ§¾ SQL Function: NormalizePrice
ðŸ“Œ Purpose:
This function standardizes a price string by removing currency symbols (like â‚¬) and converting European-style decimal formats into a normalized dot-separated decimal format.

âœ… Use Case:
Some prices may appear as:

"â‚¬1.234,56" â†’ should be normalized to "1234.56"

"1,234.56" â†’ should become "1234.56"

"1,234" â†’ becomes "1234"

"123,45" â†’ becomes "123.45"

This function ensures consistency for further processing or numeric conversion.

ðŸ“¥ Input:
sql

@price NVARCHAR(50)
A price string, possibly containing:

Currency symbols (like â‚¬)

Thousand separators (commas or dots)

Decimal indicators (commas or dots)
